Project Overview:

This travel Agent app allows users to search for data on cities they want to visit.
You can view data on cities that are in the database. You can add data on a city to the database if it is not already there.
You can update existing data in the database and you can delete data entirely on a chosen city from the database.


Tech Stack:

Front End (Angular): The client-side part of the application that interacts with users. It sends requests to the back end and displays data.

Back End (Node.js + Express): The server-side part of the application that handles requests from the front end, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.

Database (MongoDB): The storage part of the application that stores data related to travel destinations, activities, users, reviews, and photos.
